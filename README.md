# labReport1A
MATLAB code for Lab Report 1A

I wrote code in MATLAB that:
- generates 10 random sets of 10 students' small cell widths
- calculates the avg and stdev of each set
- creates and exports a labeled bar graph with error bars
- performs a paired T test between dataset 1 and datasets 2 to 10
- writes two .xlsx files with the datasets ("Datasets.xlsx") and the avg, stdev, and |t| ("Calculations.xlsx")
