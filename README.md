# labReport1A
MATLAB code for Lab Report 1A

I wrote code in MATLAB that:
- generates 10 random sets of 10 students' small cell widths
- calculates the avg and stdev of each set
- creates and exports a labeled bar graph with error bars
- writes a .xlsx file with the datasets, avgs, and stdevs
- performs a paired T test between dataset 1 and datasets 2 to 10
